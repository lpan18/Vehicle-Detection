## Implementation Steps
- under current directory, run `python eval.py <img_300x300.png>`, making sure that the image is 300x300 dimension with (0 - 255, 0 - 255, 0 - 255) pixel values
    - USE_GPU boolean controls whether to involve a GPU CUBA calculation
    - WILL_TEST boolean controls whether to test

## Note for the training
- to run the training with local images, make sure to put two folders within current folder named after <sample_img_name> and <sample_img_name_labels>
